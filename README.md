Software Sprint - season 2

### Project Title
Student Community Website

### About the Project

A student community website is an online platform specifically designed to
bring together students from a particular educational institution or a broader
academic network. The website serves as a hub for students to connect with
their peers and establish meaningful relationships. It provides various
networking features that enable students to create user profiles, search and
connect with other students, and engage in discussions on forums or chat
platforms. By facilitating these interactions, the website encourages students
to build social connections, share ideas, and collaborate on academic projects.
Moreover, a student community website often promotes events, clubs, and
extracurricular activities. It offers features such as event calendars, club
listings, enabling students to stay informed about upcoming activities and
get involved in campus life. This aspect of the website encourages students to
explore their interests, participate in various events, and engage in a vibrant
and dynamic campus community.
The website also plays a vital role in providing support and mentoring services
to students. It may offer features like mentorship programs, peer tutoring
platforms, or access to counseling resources. These support mechanisms
ensure that students have access to guidance, assistance, and emotional
support when needed, enhancing their overall well-being and academic
success.
