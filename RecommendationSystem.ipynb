Once it’s used to being in the cage, start closing the door for short periods of time so your dog doesn’t get too anxious. Then, increase the time until your dog is comfortable for longer periods. However, you shouldn't leave your dog in its cage for more than 4 hours during the day. You should always take your dog for a short walk and let it relieve itself before shutting it inside the kennel, so it doesn’t need to do its business inside.\n",

Then, lay out the sweater on a flat surface with the front side facing up and figure out there you want to position each ornament. For example, you might want to line the collar, sleeves, or bottom of the sweater, or cover the entire surface. Once everything is in the place, thread hooks or wire through the ornament’s hole, thread that through the sweater, and tie it off or twist it so that the ornament won’t come loose. Be sure to put your sweater on carefully so that you don’t knock off any ornaments!\n",

      "How To Make Vodka\n",
      "To make your own vodka, start by heating water, flaked wheat, and crushed wheat malt in a 10-gallon pot to make a wheat mash base. After a couple of hours, cool the mash and let it sit overnight. Then, strain the mash into a food-grade bucket or carboy, and stir some distillers yeast into it to kick off the fermentation process. Once you've added the mash and yeast, attach an airlock to the top of the container so carbon dioxide can get out but oxygen can't get in. When you're finished, siphon off the fermented, alcoholic liquid into a clean container, and leave the yeast sediment behind. Add the alcoholic liquid to a still, then heat it to separate the alcohol and water. Throw away the first distilled liquid, which is toxic and dangerous to drink. After that, collect the rest of the distilled liquid, and test it with an alcometer to see how strong it is. If you'd like, you can distill it a few more times to make your vodka stronger and purer. Finish by filtering the vodka through an activated carbon filter and diluting it with water until it's at your desired strength.\n",

      "If your orchid plant has lost all its flowers, it’s probably gone into a dormant stage. To get it blooming again, try cutting it back or repotting it. After the flowers fall off, use some sharp, sterile pruning shears to cut the stalk down to no less than 1 inch above the soil. If possible, make the cut about 1/4 inch above a node, which looks like a small bump on the stem. If you notice the orchid’s roots sticking out of the bottom of its pot, water the plant and then gently tug it to remove the plant and its roots from the soil. Brush off any growing medium clinging to the roots and transplant the orchid to a larger pot. Once the orchid is in its new pot, give it a boost of nutrients by filling the pot with a mixture of 2 parts bark-based orchid growing medium and 1 part peat moss. Fill in the space around the roots, but take care not to cover any of the leaves so you don't smother them.\n",

      "To play cricket, first gather 2 teams of 11 players. You will also need a ball, a cricket bat, and two wickets. Wickets are made of three sticks driven into the ground called “stumps,” topped by two horizontal sticks called “bails.” The goal of the game is to score more points, or runs, than the other team. Toss a coin to decide which team will bat in the first inning. The first batting team sends 2 batsmen onto the field, one in front of each wicket, while all members of the bowling team spread out. The bowling team throws, or bowls the ball at a batsman. The batting team tries to score as many points, called runs, as they can before the inning is over. To score a run, both batsmen must run past each other to the opposite wicket while a ball is in play. The inning ends when the bowling team finishes their limited number of bowls or gets 10 of the 11 batsmen out. To get a batsman out, the bowling team can catch the ball before it hits the ground. If the bails behind the batsman are dislodged, the batsman is also out. This can be done by the batsman missing a bowled ball that hits the wicket. It can also happen if the batsman steps too far forward, misses the ball, and is unable to return to the wicket before the opposing team knocks down the bails. Lastly, the bowling side can hit the stumps with the ball before the running batsmen make it to the opposite wicket. Once a batsman is out, they leave the field and are replaced by another teammate. In the second inning, the bowling team becomes the batting team and tries to outscore the other team.\n",

      "How To Get Rid of Ants\n",
      "To get rid of ants, soak a sponge in a mixture of dish soap, or vinegar, and water and use the sponge to wipe up the ants and their trail. It is important to fully wipe up the trail so other ants in the colony don't follow it later. If there are too many ants to wipe up, you can use a vacuum to suck them up instead. Make sure you empty the vacuum bag afterward into a sealed space or else the ants can escape and return back into your home. After you are done vacuuming, it is still important to go back and wipe up the ant trail with soapy water or a vinegar solution. If the ants come back, you can try putting commercial bait traps around your home in spaces where you see ants as this bait will kill an entire colony, if it makes its way to the queen. The traps will likely attract many ants so be careful where you put them. You may also need to replace the trap once the ants eat all of the poison. Be patient as it sometimes takes several weeks before a set of traps will successfully remove a colony.\n",

      "How To Calculate Implicit Interest Rate\n",
      "Implicit interest rate is the interest rate implied when borrowing a fixed amount of money and returning a different amount of money in the future. To calculate the implicit interest rate, divide the amount you’ll pay back by the amount you borrowed. Then, raise the result by the power of 1 divided by the number of periods, in this case years. So, if you borrow 100,000 dollars and promise to pay back 125,000 in 5 years, you’d divide 125,000 by 100,000 to give you 1.25. Then, raise this to the power of 1 divided by 5, which is 0.2, to give you 1.0456. Finally, subtract this by 1, then multiply it by 100 to give you the percentage. 1.0456 minus 1 would give you 0.456. Then, you'd multiply that by 100 and get 4.56. Therefore, the implicit interest rate is 4.56 percent.\n",

Try to react to the thought behind the gift by saying things like “I really appreciate that you thought of me” or “What a thoughtful gift.” If the gift giver starts to ask questions about if you’ll use the present or how often, distract them by asking them questions about the present, like where they found it or what made them think of it for you. If you’re really close to the person who gave you the gift, tell them the truth if they push and, hopefully, have a good laugh about it.\n",

      "How To Do Division\n",
      "To do simple division, think about how many times one number can go into another number. For example, 6 ÷ 2 is 3, because 3 goes into 6 two times. For larger numbers, it's helpful to spend time reviewing the multiplication tables. To do long division, write the number you want to divide under the division bar, and place the number you want to divide by outside of the bar. For example, if you want to calculate 72 ÷ 3, place 72 under the division bar and 3 outside of it. Then, calculate how many times 3 goes into the first number under the division bar. In this case, you’re calculating how many times 3 goes into 7. The answer is 2, with 1 left over. Write the number 2 above the bar, and the remainder – in this case, 1 – below the 7. Then, if there are any numbers left under the division bar, bring them down to the same row as the remainder. So in this case, you’d write a 2 beside the 1 to get 12. Then, repeat the process: how many times does 3 go into 12? In this example, 3 goes into 12 four times, so you’d write 4 on the line above the problem, beside the other numbers. Therefore, 72 ÷ 3 = 24.\n",
